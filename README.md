### Overview
This project consists of two notebooks developed as part of the Earth Surface Processes Institute (ESPIn) to explore Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and synthetic landscape models. The notebooks focus on the Teton Fault in Wyoming and provide a comprehensive exercise for students, including those who cannot participate in fieldwork.

### Notebooks
1. **Teton_part1**:
   - **Purpose**: To run experiments using real DEM data from the Teton Fault.

2. **Teton_part2**:
   - **Purpose**: To run a synthetic landscape evolution model using imported field measurements.

### Purpose
These notebooks provide an opportunity for students to engage in landscape evolution modeling, offering an alternative for those unable to attend fieldwork. By comparing DEM-derived data with synthetic models, students gain practical experience in topographic analysis and model evaluation.

### Learning Outcomes
- Analyze and interpret DEM data using landscape evolution models.
- Simulate and evaluate synthetic landscapes against real-world observations.
- Develop critical thinking by comparing real and synthetic landscape models.
- Gain hands-on experience with landscape modeling tools and techniques.

### How to Use
1. **Teton_part1**:
   - Download and set up the DEM data using the provided instructions.
   - Run the simulations and analyze the results as described.
   - Complete the provided tasks to understand the real-world topographic features.

2. **Teton_part2**:
   - Import field measurements and set up the synthetic landscape model.
   - Perform the simulations and compare the results with the DEM data.
   - Analyze the differences and draw conclusions based on the model comparisons.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Landlab
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
- OpenTopography API access

### Homework Assignment
3. Extra: **Steady_State_HW**:    
    Tasks:
    - Load a DEM and run it to a steady state using a landscape evolution model.
    - Calculate and visualize the mean elevation and erosion rates for the DEM.
    - Your Task: Load the synthetic landscape and compare it with the DEM.
