## Teton Fault Landscape Evolution Model (LEM) Notebook

### Overview
This notebook was developed as part of the Earth Surface Processes Institute (ESPIn) to demonstrate the use of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and synthetic data in Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs). The case study focuses on the Teton Fault in Wyoming, providing insights into topographic analysis, landscape dynamics, and numerical modeling of fault-driven processes.

### Purpose
This notebook is an excellent exercise for students, especially those who cannot attend fieldwork, offering a virtual environment to explore real-world geological processes. By using this tool, students can analyze the Teton Fault's catchment topography, simulate landscape evolution, and compare natural observations with synthetic data, all from the classroom.

### Features
- Topographic Analysis: Includes tools to extract channel longitudinal profiles, analyze channel steepness, and calculate channel chi.
- Numerical Modeling: Simulates landscape evolution based on stream power erosion and diffusion processes.
- Fieldwork Alternative: Designed as a substitute for field-based exercises, providing an immersive learning experience.
- Homework Assignment: The notebook contains a homework component, allowing students to apply what they've learned by interpreting data and presenting findings.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand and apply topographic analysis techniques using DEMs.
- Simulate and evaluate landscape evolution using numerical models.
- Compare synthetic landscape models to natural observations.
- Develop critical thinking by completing the provided homework assignment.

### How to Use
1. Set Up: Follow the instructions in the notebook to download the necessary DEM data from OpenTopography using the provided API.
2. Run the Notebook: Step through each section, following the instructions to perform the topographic analysis and run the simulations.
3. Homework: Complete the homework exercise by analyzing specific datasets and answering questions on landscape evolution processes.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Landlab
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

### Homework Assignment
The homework included in this notebook asks students to:
- Analyze the Teton Fault's topography using DEM data.
- Compare the results with the synthetic model output.
- Interpret the results and discuss the implications for fault-driven landscape evolution.
- Submit a brief report summarizing their findings.
